This is a [fortune] file constructed from the quotes at the start of every
chapter in [Dune: The Machine Crusade] [1]. None are missing (to my knowledge),
and no other quotes from the book are included.

You can create a fortune-readable file by running `strfile
dune-the-machine-crusade`, then either copying the resulting
`dune-the-machine-crusade.dat` file to your system's fortune directory (usually
`/usr/share/fortune/`), or by pointing fortune directly at the directory in
which the .dat is located.
