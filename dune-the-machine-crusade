The weakness of thinking machines is that they actually *believe* all the
information they receive, and react accordingly.

Though Norma Cenva saw great revelations in the intricacies of the cosmos,
sometimes she could not distinguis night from day, or one plce from another.
Perhaps she did not need to identify such things, because she was capable of
journeying across an entire universe in her mind.

Was her brain physically capable of assembling huge quantities of data and using
that information to identify large-scale events and complex trends? Or was it
instead some inexplicable extrasensory phenomenon that enabled her to exceed the
thinking capacities of any person who had lived before her? Or of any thinking
machine?

Generations later, her biographers would argue over her mental powers, but Norma
herself might not have resolved the debate. Realistically, she would have cared
less about *how* her brain worked than she cared about the actual performance of
her mind and the incredible results of its inquireies.

Peering back through the magnifying glass of time, men and women in the future
view the personalities of the Great Revolt as larger than life. Such an
impression comes not through any distortion of the glass, nor from a process of
embellishment that generates mythology. Instead, the heroes of the Jihad were
much as they are now remembered; they rose to the occasion when humanity needed
them more than ever before.

Unfortunately, some wars are won by the side that is the most fanatical in a

The army fosters technology, and technology breeds anarchy because it

Biological life is an insidious, powerful force. Even when one thinks it has
been wiped out, it has a way of concealing itself... and regenerating. When the
human mind is combined with this ultimate survival instinct, we have a
formiddable enemy.

How interesting it would be if I could upload and share information from
sentient biological life, like computers transferring data. So much
investigative effort and useless conjecture would be saved, because I could
spend time deep inside the mind of my subjects. In a sense that has been the
goal of my human experiments all along, and to an extent I have climbed inside
their collective skin, allowing me to think as they think. But humans have
shallow and deep levels of thought and of behavior, and for the most part I have
only discovered the shallow. Each locked psychic door that I finally open
reveals another locked door, and another, and another... each requiring a
different key. Such complex, mysterious creatures, these humans. To construct
one from scratch... what a supreme challenge that would be!
  -- Erasmus, Reflections on Sentient Biologicals

Through his mind and senses, the human anticipates bits and pieces of the
reality to come. Despite endless calculations, thinking machines can never come
close to achieving this, or even comprehending how it works.
